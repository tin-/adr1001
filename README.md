Current Status
--------------
* Drift data collection/analysis : planned Q3'2024, initial checks in progress...
* Mid-term 3000 hours drift evaluation: planned Q4'2024
* Short-term noise evaluation: planned Q4'2024
* Tempco evaluation: planned Q4'2024
* PSRR evaluation: planned Q4'2024

Introduction
------------

This repository contains the data collected on in-house coming soon voltage reference modules assembled with [Analog Devices ADR1001AEZ]([https://xdevs.com/article/adr1000order/](https://xdevs.com/pow/adr1k1_pow/)) buried zener IC. Consistent with my primary use cases for these devices in DC voltage metrology projects, these modules designed with focus on lower integration cost and good stability below 10 ppm/year. 

Issues and caveats
------------------

TBD.
